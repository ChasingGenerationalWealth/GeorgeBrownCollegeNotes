# Week 1 - 5 Study Notes

## Week 1 - History
- First Writing was ~ 5,000 years ago: Clay tablets in Mesopotamia & used for practical records like receipts.
  - Cuneiform: Wedge-shaped marks pressed into clay.
- Babylonian Numerals: System using two types of wedges, one means 10 the other means 1. Numbers up to 59 are jsut sum of the two types wedges.
  - Then positional base-60 system similar to modern base-10.
- There were other number systems used such as:
  - Egyptian: Symbols for powers of 10.
  - Roman: Subtractive notation (e.g., MCM = 1900)
- Epic of Gilgamesh was about 4,000 years ago
- Early Printing Techniques include; Cylinder Seals: Used in Mesopotamia for stamping & Woodblock Printing: Old wood-block print dated 868 AD in the text itself (Diamond Sutra).
- Movable Type was invented to Enabled rearranging characters for different texts. This also drastically reduced the price of printing and books.
  - Gutenberg Press was a form which Revolutionized printing with metal movable type.
    - Gutenberg Bible: Luxury item, 180 copies produced.
- Modern Writing Systems
  - Alphabet Development: Phoenician Alphabet is ancestor of many modern alphabets. There are independent Systems such as Chinese, Mesoamerican, and others
  - Typewriters and Keyboards Purpose was to standardize text appearance, especially in business. Monospace Fonts was developed for typewriters, used in coding.   
- Key Terminology: Typeface - Design of letters, Font - Collection of typefaces, Serif/Sans Serif - Fonts with/without decorative strokes, Uppercase/Lowercase - Originated from physical storage cases.

## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Binary System: Are numbers that are represented using base 2. A "Bit" is short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1). A Byte is a group of 8 bits.
- Memory Types: There are two notable types of memory. Volatile Memory: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM). Non-Volatile Memory: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).
- Number Representation: Unsigned Numbers have a range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits. Signed Numbers have a range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits. Fractional Numbers are represented using scientific notation with two integers.
- ASCII Table: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').
- Types of Files: Text Files are interpreted as characters using ASCII. Binary Files are not intended to be read as text (code).
- Number Systems: Decimal (Base 10): Standard human number system, Binary (Base 2): Used in computing &amp; Hexadecimal (Base 16): Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.

## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Lines and Indentation: Lines are fundamental in coding. Indentation helps in visual understanding.
- Markdown: Simple syntax for formatting. Rendering: Conversion from raw text to formatted view.
- HTML: More verbose than Markdown.
- HTML Escaping: Escape sequences prevent special interpretation. Example, "/#" to display a hash.
- JSON: Human-readable and widely used for data interchange.
- XML: Similar to HTML, used for data representation.
  
## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- Types of Keyboards: Standard 104-key layout, split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.
- Keyboard Layouts: QWERTY,AZERTY,Dvorak
- Word Processors (e.g., Microsoft Word) vs. Text Editors (e.g., Notepad)
- Vim: Command-line based, requires learning command
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Widely used, feature-rich
- IDEs: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm
- Regex (Regular Expressions): For pattern matching
- Wildcards: Use /* for any character sequence.

## Week 5 - Command Line Interface/C.L.I.
- The History of Command Line Interface: Originated from teletype machines connected to computers. Commands were typed and printed on paper, later replaced by screens. Commands were often short due to historical reasons.
- Advantages of Modern C.L.I include; Some functions are only available via CLI, Faster for certain tasks compared to graphical interfaces, Easier automation, Efficient for remote work with low bandwidth requirements & minimal resource usage on a computer.
- SSH (Secure Shell): Connect to remote computers securely.
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) : Run Linux within Windows for development & Use Linux tools and commands alongside Windows applications.
